# Changelog

## v0.19.1 - 2026-02-15

### Bug Fixes

- **Import clears session state**: Both full-replace and merge imports now reset `viewingProjectId`, `forecastInputs`, and `burnUpConfigs` to prevent stale UI state referencing deleted projects

### Housekeeping

- Removed dead code: `parseDate()` and `daysBetween()` from `dates.ts` — both were unused and had timezone bugs (missing `T00:00:00` suffix unlike every other date function in the file)

### Test Coverage

- 514 tests passing (was 447): added 72 dedicated edge-case tests for import-validation (milestones, dates, boundaries, sprint fields)
- Milestone validation: backlogSize boundaries (0, negative, > 999999), missing color, non-boolean showOnChart, > 10 milestones, duplicate IDs
- Date validation: auto-corrected dates (Feb 30), invalid leap year (2025-02-29), non-YYYY-MM-DD formats
- Sprint validation: sprintNumber boundaries (0, 10001), fractional sprintNumber, doneValue/backlogAtSprintEnd ranges
- Top-level structure: null/primitive input, missing arrays, source field

## v0.19.0 - 2026-02-15

### New Features

- **Import from SPERT Story Map**: Importing a Story Map export (`source: "spert-story-map"`) triggers a merge flow instead of a full replace. Projects are matched by name (case-insensitive); milestones are replaced with the Story Map's release breakdown, new sprints are added without overwriting existing ones, and productivity adjustments are preserved. A confirmation dialog summarizes what will be updated or added before proceeding.
- **Import confirmation dialog**: Native Forecaster imports now show a "Replace All Data" warning before overwriting localStorage, advising users to export first. Previously, importing replaced all data silently with no confirmation.

### Architecture

- **Merge-import module** (`src/shared/state/merge-import.ts`): Pure functions for Story Map format detection (`isStoryMapExport`), merge plan building (`buildMergePlan`), and plan application (`applyMergePlan`). Fully testable with no store dependencies.
- **MergeImportDialog** (`src/shared/components/MergeImportDialog.tsx`): Accessible merge confirmation dialog following ConfirmDialog patterns (focus trap, Escape, ARIA, body scroll lock)

### Test Coverage

- 447 tests passing (was 421): added 26 tests for merge-import logic (detection, name matching, sprint overlap counting, milestone replacement, data preservation)

## v0.18.0 - 2026-02-10

### New Features

- **Shareable Forecast Report**: Generate Report icon (next to CSV export and copy-image) opens a popover to generate a print-friendly HTML report in a new browser tab. Expanded charts (burn-up, CDF, histogram) are included automatically; a checkbox controls whether Forecast Results is included. Collapse any chart to exclude it. Use Cmd+P / Ctrl+P to save as PDF.
- **Consolidated action icons**: Copy-image, Generate Report, and Export CSV icons now appear together on the Forecast Results heading row

### Bug Fixes

- **Milestone filtering in results**: Forecast Results table and Forecast Summary now only show milestones where "Show on Chart" is checked, matching the existing behavior of the Burn-Up Chart and Custom Percentile selector. Previously, unchecked milestones showed misleading dates when the backlog input didn't account for their scope.
- **Chart toolbar milestone dropdown** (PR #47): CDF and histogram milestone dropdowns now filter by `showOnChart`, matching burn-up chart behavior. Auto-corrects selected milestone if it becomes hidden.
- **Burn-up chart toolbar layout** (PR #48): All controls (distribution, Show scope, 3 forecast lines, Text size, copy icon) fit on a single row. Label inputs narrowed to 88px, gap tightened. CopyImageButton moved from absolute overlay into the toolbar row.

### Test Coverage

- 421 tests passing (was 404): added 17 tests for report HTML generation and XSS escaping

## v0.17.4 - 2026-02-10

### Enhancements

- **Header theme toggle**: sun/moon/monitor icon in the top-right corner cycles through Light, Dark, and System themes without navigating to Settings
- Icon shows the next theme you'll switch to on click (moon when light, monitor when dark, sun when system)

### Housekeeping

- Removed 7 accidental duplicate files (`* 2.tsx` / `* 2.ts`) from the worktree

## v0.17.3 - 2026-02-10

### Enhancements

- **Collapsible Forecast Results**: disclosure triangle on the "Forecast Results" heading to expand/collapse the results table
- **User-selectable confidence percentiles**: P10–P90 toggle chips replace the fixed P50–P90 columns — default selection: P10/P20/P50/P80/P90
- **Dual Custom Percentile sliders**: two independent sliders with their own finish-date cards for quick confidence interval lookups
- Default percentile selections and both slider defaults are configurable in Settings and persist across sessions

### Test Coverage

- 404 tests passing (was 398)

## v0.17.2 - 2026-02-09

### UX

- **Milestone list stays visible during add/edit**: clicking "+ Add Milestone" or Edit no longer hides existing milestones — the form appears below the list so users retain full context
- **Auto-focus on form open**: Name field auto-focuses when adding or editing milestones and productivity adjustments
- Both improvements also apply to Productivity Adjustments (shared `CollapsibleCrudPanel`)

### Infrastructure

- **Single-source changelog**: `/changelog` page now parses `CHANGELOG.md` at build time instead of maintaining a separate hardcoded array — one file to update, no more drift
- Added `parseChangelog()` utility with 8 unit tests for markdown parsing
- Restored 3 missing version entries (v0.10.0, v0.11.0, v0.12.0) and enriched detail for v0.14.0–v0.17.0 that were lost during consolidation

### Test Coverage

- 398 tests passing (was 390)

## v0.17.1 - 2026-02-09

### Bug Fixes

- **Burn-up chart milestone data**: burn-up chart now uses overall simulation data instead of per-milestone data, so selecting a milestone in the Custom Percentile dropdown no longer corrupts forecast lines
- **Milestone dropdown index sync**: selecting the first visible milestone in Custom Percentile now shows correct results (auto-corrects stale index when milestones are filtered)
- **Burn-up scope line**: scope line no longer capped to milestone threshold when backlog exceeds it
- **Productivity adjustment date display**: restored year in date range display while keeping compact font

### Enhancements

- **Preset color swatches**: milestone color picker now shows 5 quick-pick swatches alongside the full custom color picker
- **Milestone dropdown filtering**: Custom Percentile dropdown only shows milestones checked for chart display
- **Milestone drag reorder**: milestones can be reordered via drag handles in the milestone list
- **Forecast summary sentence**: reordered to lead with distribution type ("Using the X distribution, there is a Y% chance...")
- **Burn-up chart sliders**: percentile sliders now step by 5 (range P5-P95) for easier control
- **Productivity end date auto-seed**: end date auto-adjusts to start + 1 day when creating/editing adjustments
- **Productivity form layout**: Name field shrunk, Memo field expanded for better space utilization
- **About page**: expanded SPERT description with full context on PERT origins and modern approach

### Decoupling

- **Backlog independence**: backlog field is fully decoupled from milestones — always editable, never auto-overridden by milestone totals

### Refactoring

- Introduced `overallSimulationData` state to separate burn-up chart data from per-milestone CDF/histogram data
- Removed dead `milestoneTotal` from `useForecastInputs` (leftover from backlog/milestone coupling)
- Hoisted duplicate `escCsv` helper to module scope in `export-csv.ts`
- Extracted milestone visibility filtering with `originalIndex` mapping for correct simulation data lookup

### Test Coverage

- Added test for CSV export with per-milestone data (`PER-MILESTONE PERCENTILE RESULTS` section)
- Added float-parsing edge cases for scope growth custom input
- Added sentence-order assertion for forecast summary text
- 390 tests passing (was 363)

## v0.17.0 - 2026-02-07

### Features

- **Subjective Forecasting (Cold-Start Mode)**: Teams with no sprint history can now produce probabilistic forecasts using a velocity estimate and variability level
- Forecast mode toggle: pill-style switch between History and Subjective modes
- Auto-detects mode based on sprint count (5+ sprints → History, otherwise Subjective)
- CV elicitation UI: 6 radio buttons (Very Low to Extreme) with dynamic velocity range labels
- Two new probability distributions: Triangular and Uniform
- Mode-aware results tables: Subjective shows T-Normal, Lognormal, Triangular, Uniform; History shows T-Normal, Lognormal, Gamma, Bootstrap
- All 6 distributions available in burn-up chart distribution selector regardless of mode
- CDF, histogram, and burn-up charts render mode-appropriate distributions
- CSV export includes forecast mode metadata and mode-appropriate distribution columns

### Volatility Adjuster (History Mode)

- **Opt-in volatility adjustment** for History mode: adjust the calculated standard deviation with human-readable multipliers
- 4 radio options: Less volatile (0.75x), Match history (1.0x), Slightly more volatile (1.25x), Much more volatile (1.5x)
- Each option shows a rounded velocity range preview (e.g., "45–95") using the existing `roundRange()` function
- Inline toggle link ("Adjust" / "Close") in the Std Dev helper text — zero layout disruption
- Std Dev field becomes read-only when adjuster is active; reverts to editable when closed
- Collapsing the adjuster resets multiplier to 1.0; expanding clears any manual SD override
- Amber color scheme distinguishes from Subjective mode's blue CV selector
- Volatility multiplier included in CSV export when ≠ 1.0

### Engine

- `createSampler` expanded with optional bounds parameter for Triangular/Uniform distributions
- `runAllDistributions` now sweeps all 6 distributions (was 4)
- `randomTriangular` and `randomUniform` math functions with floor-at-zero safety
- Expanded `QuadSimulationData`, `QuadCustomResults`, and milestone types for 6 distributions
- `effectiveStdDev` in History mode now applies `calculatedStdDev * volatilityMultiplier`

### UX

- Forecast summary shows data source context (sprint history, subjective judgment, or manual overrides)
- Forecast results footer shows effective mean, SD, and CV values used in simulation
- Last sprint backlog shown under Backlog field as helper text
- Subjective mode pre-seeds velocity from calculated history when available
- Tab order skips read-only fields (Start Date, milestone-controlled Backlog) and decorative elements (sparkline chart)

### Test Coverage

- New tests for `randomTriangular`, `randomUniform`, CV rounding helpers
- New tests for `VOLATILITY_OPTIONS` ordering, values, and `DEFAULT_VOLATILITY_MULTIPLIER`
- New tests for volatility multiplier in CSV export
- Updated existing tests for expanded data structures
- 363 tests passing (was 338)

## v0.16.1 - 2026-02-06

### Bug Fixes

- Burn-up chart forecast lines now target highest visible milestone instead of always extending to total project scope
- Historical scope line capped to milestone target, eliminating misleading cliff at forecast boundary

### Dark Mode

- Active tab dimmed to `blue-700` for reduced glare against dark backgrounds
- Export/Import buttons switch to ghost variants (outlined with tinted background) in dark mode
- Add Milestone/Add Adjustment buttons use matching ghost variant in dark mode
- Tab container border visible in dark mode (`gray-700`)

## v0.16.0 - 2026-02-05

### Features

- Custom scope growth override: choose between calculated rate (from sprint history) or a user-specified custom rate
- Radio button selection between Calculated and Custom when scope growth is enabled
- Custom input allows negative values for scope shrinking scenarios
- Warning indicator applies to whichever mode is active (calculated or custom)
- Summary text indicates source: "(calculated)" or "(custom)"
- Auto-recalculation supports both modes with debounced custom input

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed scope growth not affecting milestone forecasts (milestone check now uses remaining backlog instead of cumulative velocity)
- Fixed truthiness check allowing zero scope growth to be modeled correctly
- Fixed Windows scrollbar jitter with scrollbar gutter reservation
- Dynamic copyright year derived from system date

### Refactoring

- Extracted `resolveScopeGrowthPerSprint` helper (eliminates 3x duplicated IIFE)
- Introduced `SimulationContext` interface grouping related simulation parameters
- Added `runAllDistributions<T>()` generic sweep helper (adding a distribution is now a one-line change)
- Extracted `useScopeGrowthState` hook from `useForecastState` (392 → 367 LOC)
- Extracted `BurnUpChartCanvas` from `BurnUpChart` (349 → 179 + 195 LOC)
- Extracted `ScopeGrowthSection` from `ForecastForm` (298 → 228 + 115 LOC)
- `WorkerInput` extends `SimulationContext` instead of duplicating fields

### Test Coverage

- Added deterministic scope growth tests with exact sprint count assertions and sprint-by-sprint traces
- Added `resolveScopeGrowthPerSprint` unit tests (6 cases)
- 312 tests passing (was 305)
